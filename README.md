## Introduction

Email has been around since the late 1970s.

Yet, despite being one of the oldest and most ubiquitous ways of connecting with someone else, using email still feels cumbersome and isolating.

Why must I create a filter for GitHub email when 100s of others have configured the same filter before me?

Why is it that my OTP codes are mixed into all my other emails? We even are the expired one still there until I manually clear it?

Why must I hunt around to find the unsubscribe button from a marketing email?

This is what Skylar hopes to change. We want you to feel empowered in your own space. Not trapped by tools from the past.

## Roadmap

Skylar is still early in the development. BUT, it covers the core functionality of an email client (or as some people are quick to point out, gmail client) and we'd love for you to try it and share your feedback and wants!. We are online on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Hdws2uyCU7), come say hi!

See: [Skylar's public roadmap](https://github.com/curdinc/skylar-email/issues/58) for the least of things we are actively working on and looking to support.

We are always open to new feature requests!

## Comparisons

There has been multiple comparisons to Thunderbird and how we differ. This list is provides non comprehensive overview. Note that we have all the love and appreciation for the good folks working on Thunderbird and hold them as an inspiration.

Finally, many of these things are still works in progress and we are not at the point where many (if any) of these points are true yet.

1. Web first - this is a blessing and a curse, but allows us to support all major platforms (pretty soon) via browser first and Pwa second. Thunderbird today only runs on desktop with a separate android app via k-9
1. Keyboard emphasis - You will be able to use as much or as little keyboard as you want. I personally use more keyboard than mouse, but with thunderbird, I notice myself picking the mouse quite a bit. Things like adding labels and bulk thread management all lack keyboard support today. Skylar while similar today, is actively committing to support more actions through keyboard.
1. Modern - Looks are subjective, but as much of a keyboard warrior I am, I enjoy nice looking UIs and have bias for today's design languages. Also tabs are nice, but not having native split screen support like vs code makes it less useful.
1. Socialize the inbox management - This is still some ways off as we build a solid foundation, but eventually, you'll be able to make plugins and filters for your email and easily share that.

   This way we can push recommendation to you and inbox management becomes passive. For example, one time passwords, verification etc. can be handled via a separate tab where you can simply click to copy the codes // open the links and they automatically go away when they expire etc.
