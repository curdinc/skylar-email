## Introduction

Email has been around since 1971 (according to Google GPT).

Yet, despite being one of the oldest and most ubiquitous ways of connecting with someone else, using email still feels cumbersome and isolating.

Why must I create a filter for GitHub email when 100s of others have configured the same filter before me?

Why is it that my OTP codes are mixed into all my other emails? We even are the expired one still there until I manually clear it?

Why must I hunt around to find the unsubscribe button from a marketing email?

This is what Skylar hopes to change. We want you to feel empowered in your own space. Not trapped by tools from the past.

## Roadmap

Skylar is still very early in development. BUT, we'd love for you to try it and share your feedback and hopes!. We are online on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Hdws2uyCU7), come say hi!

See: [Skylar's public roadmap](https://github.com/curdinc/skylar-email/issues/58) for the least of things we are actively working on and looking to support.
